1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase? 
*   When the number of hidden nodes increase the accuracy also increases and then decreases after a certain point
2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
*   As the number of hidden units increases the it gives the NN the capacity to learn complex patterns quickly but then accuracy decreases probably due to overfitting
*   It also provides better feature extraction if the number of hidden nodes are more
